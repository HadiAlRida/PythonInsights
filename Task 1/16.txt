Python Control Flow: Loops (while loop)
A while statement in python sets aside a block of code that is to be executed repeatedly until a condition is falsified. The structure of a while loop allows the total number of iterations, or repetitions, to be unknown from the start. Examples of use cases might be repeatedly obtaining user input until the input is correct, reading lines from a file until a specific piece of information is reached, or evaluating a mathematical algorithm until a desired precision is reached. a while loop is a control flow statement similar for loops and if-elif-else.
