Python Functions: Defining Functions
Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again. Some Benefits of Using Functions: Increase the codeâ€™s readability, reusability. There are mainly two types of functions: Built-in functions these are Standard functions in Python that are available to use and user-defined function: manually created functions based on our requirements.
