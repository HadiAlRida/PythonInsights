Into Python history In the late 1980s, history in the programming domain was about to be written. 
It was that time when working on Python started. Soon after that, Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica which is situated in the Netherlands. It was started as a hobby project because he was looking for a project to keep him occupied during Christmas. 
The programming language in which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and had the feature of exception handling.
