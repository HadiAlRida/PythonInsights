String Data Type in Python
Strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. 
In Python there is no character data type. It is represented by str class.
In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed within either single, double or triple .
It is an immutable data type, which means once a string is created, it cannot be modified. 
However, it is possible to create a new string by concatenating two or more strings.
