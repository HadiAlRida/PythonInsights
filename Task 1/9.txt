Python Data Types: Dictionaries
It is a data structure, used to store values in key:value format.
This makes it different from lists, tuples as in a dictionary each key has an associated value.
A dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly braces, separated by a comma.
The dictionary holds pairs of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value.
Values in a dictionary can be of any data type, whereas keys aren't repeated and immutable. 
In Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered and can not contain duplicate values.
